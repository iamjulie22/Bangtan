      "info": "As main rapper and leader of BTS, Kim Nam-joon -- also known as RM -- topped charts and broke records across the globe with the K-pop powerhouse boy band, while also launching a successful solo career in 2015 with debut mixtape RM. He followed in 2018 with Mono. Born in Ilsan, South Korea, he developed a love of hip-hop at a young age and honed his English skills by viewing the American television show Friends. He started performing as Runch Randa. It wasn't until 2010, during auditions with Big Hit, that RM was recruited as the first member of BTS. On the side, RM branched out with his own solo material, debuting in 2015 with the self-titled mixtape RM, which peaked at number 12 on the U.S. World Albums chart. Three years later he issued his sophomore solo effort, Mono, which bested his previous effort with a strong number two showing on the World Albums chart. In 2021, during that year's BTS Festa, he released the solo track Bicycle.",

The album consists of a total of eight tracks including the No.1 summer hit “Dynamite” and lead single “Life Goes On”. The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new normality brought on by COVID-19: one day, the world stopped without any warning, streets erased of footsteps and the way out is nowhere near in sight. BTS echoes in a low voice the comforting message that in the face of unexpected turns “Life Goes On” and extends their hands towards the future.",

      "info": "BTS Releases 4th Studio Album “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7”! A heartfelt story of BTS and their search for their “real selves” BTS will release their fourth studio album “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” on February 21. Unveiled last year, the MAP OF THE SOUL series contains the honest and heartfelt story of BTS and their journey of discovering their true selves. The first chapter of this story, “MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA”, sang about the world and the joy of love, and the discovery of the self as it is displayed to the world; “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” now turns inward to the shadow within in a candid acknowledgement that it, too, is part of the self. “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS since their debut as seven members of one team. The journey was not always smooth sailing, and there were special travails that they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. Now, understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of their real selves, BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their own story of finding their “real and complete selves”. Bridging fine art and popular art through such initiatives as the global art project CONNECT, BTS and the “Black Swan” art film featuring a modern dance interpretation of the early-release track, BTS is poised to show their latest growth as artist through “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7”.",

Halsey)’ BTS signals the beginning of a brand new story with the release of their newest EP MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA on April 12. As global superstars who play stadiums and are loved by countless fans across the world, BTS now looks to shape the future reflecting on and using the power they have gained while embracing all its shadows. Opening the MAP OF THE SOUL series with PERSONA, BTS talks about the joy in finding love, and reaches out to the world with the messages they want to share with their fans. The band is especially curious about the stories of each and everyone who have helped them become who they are today. There are a total of seven tracks in this album, through which BTS weaves together what they genuinely felt both within themselves and the ever-widening world around them. Through RM’s solo piece ‘Intro : Persona’, BTS asks the fundamental question: ‘Who am I?’. World-leading singer Halsey takes part as featured artist in the lead single ‘Boy With Luv (Feat. Halsey)’ where BTS talks about how true strength and love come from finding joy in the little things in life and reaching out to the world. The album includes ‘Mikrokosmos’ which paints the world around oneself through human interest and the collaboration with world-famous singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, ‘Make It Right’. In ‘HOME’, BTS finds refuge from their hardships and loneliness where their fans are. ‘Jamais Vu’ is a unit song by j-hope, Jin, Jung Kook and ‘Dionysus’ is a signature BTS hip hop track blasting ad-libs and powerful beats from start to finish.",

      "info": "Seven young men on the threshold of their 20s. Now entering their young adulthood, the members of BTS sang in their previous album, The most beautiful moment in life pt.1, about people their age being threatened by uncertainty. Released seven months after that first installment, The most beautiful moment in life pt.2 sings about the energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity. Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life isn't always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment. Continuing the tradition of the previous album, the members including RM, SUGA, j-hope, V and Jung Kook add their names to the producing and songwriting credits, showing their own growth as musicians. The lyrics are more profound and the music more passionate. The “Youth Series” concludes with The most beautiful moment in life pt.2, but the boys are only now on the starting line. “Never Mind”, BTS is just getting started.",

No longer just young boys, the album is an introduction to BTS as a group that continues to grow and develop. In each track are distilled poetic and pop emotions that allows the listener to sense both the soft and the resounding musical transformation of the group. After successfully concluding the “School Trilogy” that discusses the main topics of interest for teens—dreams, happiness and love—the new album begins to discuss “youth”. BTS has chosen the theme of “the most beautiful moment in life”, the start of one’s young adulthood in which beauty coexists with uncertainty. The most beautiful moment in life pt.1 focuses on the uncertain future more than the glamour of youth. In addition, while previous lyrical work had been credited to the rappers (RM, SUGA and j-hope), the vocal members (Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook) have now added their names to the credits for this album’s producing and songwriting.",

They warn the girl who acts like she doesn't love them not to test their love anymore. The boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, singing that their love is not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut, BTS made sure that the visuals, performance and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. Tracks that highlight the different genres of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide a clear direction of BTS' music. The title track “Danger” is a tightly-composed hybrid hip hop song with a piercing punk-rock guitar sound that features stark rap, a powerful hook and exhilarating shouting.",

This album is a culmination of the “School Trilogy” project that discusses the topics of most interest to teens their own age—dreams, happiness and love. Such penetrating insight into the hearts and minds of young people led to the absolute support that BTS has received from fans their age. The members again directly participated in the making of the songs, vowing to ensure that the songs reflect the reality of the music fans of their own generation.",

While billed as a single, the album boasts an impressive 27-minute runtime. This is the product of the firm conviction and passion of BTS that hip hop musicians must make their voices heard through their albums. Each member flexed their musical prowess by taking part in creating the lyrics and music for every song on the album. BTS has repeatedly said that “hip hop is genuine music for telling one’s own story,” and indeed the members rap about their own experiences and emotions.
